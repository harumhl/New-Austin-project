      Most people will be walking within the city
      <ul>
        <li>
          If there is an emergency, emergency personnel would be able to drive
          some sort of electronic bicycle
        </li>
        <li>
          The city will support riding bicycles and wheelchairs (and skateboards
          and what not)
        </li>
        <li>
          Anyone who needs to go to out of city will be able to access their car
          in garages at the "edges" of the city
        </li>
        <li>
          The only other vehicles allowed in the city will be for heavy duty
          (and out of necessity) such as transporting concrete for fixing
          buildings in the middle of city
        </li>
        <li>
          All everyday logistics will happen underground. For example, all goods
          delivered to grocery market and Target will be received at the
          designated garages on edges of the city, then will be transported to
          designated storage underground. There will be freight-specific
          elevators to transport goods to the underground then back to the
          stores.
        </li>
        <li>
          For personal mails, all mails and deliveries will be sent to the hub
          in the city before distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          The city will be small enough that an average person will not need
          buses, trams or underground subways
        </li>
        <li>
          We will have transportation to connect two cities in between (as well
          as a walkable path and a bike road)
        </li>
        <li>
          After grocery shopping, people can take the cart to their apartment.
          Once they are done unloading in their apartment, they can return it at
          the return location of each floor. The system will gather it on the
          first floor hub and we will have an employee collecting from different
          apartments back to the grocery store.
