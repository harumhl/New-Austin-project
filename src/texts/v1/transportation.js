          If there is an emergency, emergency personnel would be able to drive

          Anyone who needs to go to a city will be able to access their car in
          garages at the "edges" of the city
          <ul>
            <li>
              The garages may be further outside than the edges of the city,
              especially if the urban planners deem that the city will grow too
              fast to justify building on the current edges of the city. Then
              the city will have means to take the residents from the edges of
              the city to designated garages (which the service may NOT be free
              nor covered by stipend)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          As the city grows, such garages on the edges (which are no longer on
          edges) will be transformed to ___
        </li>
        <li>
          Heavy duty logistics can happen inside the city as needed, but will
          only be available at work (e.g. transporting concrete for buildings in
          the middle of city)
        </li>
        <li>
          All everyday logistics will happen underground. For example, all goods
          delivered to grocery market and Target will be received at the
          designated garages on edges of the city, then will be transported to
          designated stores underground. There will be freight-specific
          elevators to transport goods to the underground then back to the
          stores.
        </li>
        <li>
          For personal mails, all mails and deliveries will be sent to the hub
          in the middle of the city before distribution. As the city grows, it
          will be changed to region-specific hubs.
