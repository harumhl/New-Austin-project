              ChatGPT said it costs about $100-$400 of construction cost per one
              square feet
              <ul>
                <li>
                  e.g. 1 apartment building of (600 sq ft x 6 per floor x 5
                  floors) + (1200 sq ft x 3 per floor x 5 floors) = a building
                  for 112 people based on the average 2.5 people per household =
                  36,000 sq ft = 3.6M ($3.6 million)

          Parking: Assuming most newcomers will have cars, everyone will get
          free parking pass for one year. After that, you will have to pay for
          it. The city will help you sell your car
        </li>
        <li>
          When the city is deemed successful enough, we will attempt to expand
          to a new location. If more people wants to join the original city
          before the expansion, they will have to wait.

              We may not get to start the city #2 until we financially break
              even between community tax and infra + welfare

              For infrastructure, the initial cost can be covered by me, but the
              maintenance cost and the replacement cost should be covered by the
              community tax

          Handling snow and heavy rain is built into the city - How? What?

        <li>
          All self storages will be underground. Will we be able to do this in
          version 1? If not, that means people would have to rent storage space
          "out of town"
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone will have access to the roofs of all buildings and see how
          the crops are growing. Access to the roof will also give them a chance
          to see the skyline
        </li>
        <li>
          Each town will have a max capacity size designed (e.g. 1000 people).
          Once that is reached then we will shoot for building a neighboring
          city instead of expanding the original city

        <li>Central buildings may have escalators on top of elevators</li>

              Should restaurants be like food court to share seating? Maybe not
              all of them if some of them need better lighting and mood?

            <li>
              One floor will contain all government offices. It will be easy for
              people to come to the City Hall and voice their opinions on
              governing and budgeting

          Water will be cleaned within the city and electricity will be
