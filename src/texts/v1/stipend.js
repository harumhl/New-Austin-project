      Everyone will get stipends to cover a small apartment with enough simple
      food to survive.
      <ul>
        <li>
          People with income will be able to combine their stipend and their
          income to move to a bigger apartment
        </li>
        <li>
          People will be able to purchase plenty of fruits, vegetables and meats
          using their monthly stipend
        </li>
        <li>
          If someone doesn't want to work at all and doesn't mind a small
          apartment with simple meals, they will be able to live off of stipends
          for ever (?)
          <ul>
            <li>
              After getting out of their burnout, it is guessed that they will
              likely contribute to the society in other means (e.g. volunteer)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>People will not be able to use their stipends to dine out</li>
        <li>
          There won't be strings attached for getting stipends (except heavy
          illegal activities)
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone with income will be paying community tax which will go
          towards:
          <ul>
            <li>Paying their own and others' stipends</li>
            <li>
              Community infrastructure including apartments, parks, water
              system, electricity system, Internet system, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Initially, I (Haru) will be purchasing most of the apartments so the
          community tax will go towards maintaining the apartment buildings as
          well as foods. I will not need to collect money for owning the
          apartments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stipend will NOT cover Internet bills. Everyone will be able to use
          Internat at the local library instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stipend will cover <i>reasonable minimum amount</i> of water and
          electricity bills.
        </li>
        <li>
          There will be a high transparency on where the community tax is going.
          The community tax will NOT be used for military, highways, gas
          stations, car wash, (general parking lots) etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Things that MAY NOT be covered by stipends in the first few years
          <ul>
            <li>schools</li>
            <li>medical bills</li>
            <li>other essential items (e.g. tampoms)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm open to support people who are going through burnout, but I don't
          want this city to be a dead city (e.g. 80% of the residents are never
          leaving their apartment while recovering) and I want the community tax
          to fully cover the stipends in the long run (e.g. different 20% of the
          population are on recovery mode at different times while the other 80%
          of the people can support that 20%). I am open to support the stipends
          the first few years, but I'd like to use my money for building more
          infrastructure and new cities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Those who donâ€™t pay community taxes will have more requirements
          (mostly because of mental health concern and to push for building a
          community, and not necessarily "punishing" them for taking free money)
          <ul>
            <li>Required to attend the gym at least once a week</li>
            <li>Required to attend one apartment RA event a week</li>
            <li>Required to attend one community event a week</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
