      Everyone will get a small apartment with enough simple food to survive.

        <li>
          People with income will be able to combine their stipend and their
          income to move to a bigger apartment
        </li>
        <li>
          People will be able to purchase plenty of fruits, vegetables and meats
          using their monthly stipend
        </li>
        <li>
          If someone doesn't want to work at all and doesn't mind a small
          apartment with simple meals, they will be able to live off of stipends
          for ever
          <ul>
            <li>
              After getting out of their burnout, they will likely contribute to
              the society in other means
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>People will not be able to use their stipends to dine out</li>
        <li>
          There will be hardly any strings attached for getting housing for free
          (except heavy illegal activities)
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone with income will be paying community tax which will go
          towards:
          <ul>
            <li>Paying their own and others' stipends</li>
            <li>
              Community infrastructure including apartments, parks, water
              system, electricity system, Internet system, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Initially, <i>I</i> will be purchasing most of the apartments so the
          community tax will go towards maintaining the apartment buildings as
          well as foods. I will not need to collect money for owning the
          apartments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stipend will NOT cover Internet bills. Everyone will be able to use
          Internat at the local library instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stipend will cover <i>reasonable minimum amount</i> of water and
          electricity bills.
        </li>
        <li>
          There will be a high transparency on where the community tax is going.
          The community tax will NOT be used for military, highways, gas
          stations, (general parking lots) etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most apartments will have white roofs for better climate control
        </li>
        <li>
          There will be hardly any houses and purchasing houses will be highly
          discouraged (e.g. high property tax) as one person owning a large sum
          of land will likely push people to live further away from each other.
          <ul>
            <li>
              For noise concerns, the newer apartments will be built with better
              noise handling technologies
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          In the long run, "essential" items that aren't foods will be covered
          by stipends (e.g. tampons). In the first few years, the plan is to ___
        </li>
        <li>
          Your apartment <i>number</i> will be four digit alphanumeric letters.
          For example, someone who lives in area B, building G, 4th floor and
          8th apartment will have an apartment <i>number</i> of BG48.
