      Everyone will belong to a few groups of communities, some by choice and
      others by chance
      <ul>
        <li>
          RAs will host an event once a month for each floor and everyone will
          be encouraged to join
        </li>
        <li>
          There will be multiple community activities going on where people
          would be encouraged to join
          <ul>
            <li>
              Just like high school in Japan, each resident may be required to
              pick up something and commit (It is okay to rotate initially, but
              you'll be discouraged from staying home all the time)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          In order to promote diversities, the diversity of people (e.g. race,
          gender, LGBTQ status, disabilities) will be considered in accepting
          people into the residents
        </li>
        <li>
          We will try for diversities, but some groups of people may be excluded
          or less included in the first few years due to funding reasons. That
          includes people with severe medical conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
