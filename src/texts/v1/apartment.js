    <ul>
      <li>
        Nobody lives on the actual first floor. The first floor would be
        referred to as a ground floor and would contain offices, business
        centers, and such. First aid kit room as well
      </li>
      <li>
        Every apartment will have water tank system to store rainwater to water
        the vegetables
      </li>
      <li>
        The outer walls may have solar panels since all the roof will be taken
        with vegetables. If not possible, many local electricity generation may
        happen with wind power.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apartment will have common elements in style/look/structure (e.g. 10
        floors, 5 or 10 apartment per floor) but will have diverse architectural
        element too
      </li>
      <li>Each apartment will have at least one elevators</li>
      <li>“Floor mates” are encouraged to get to know each other</li>
      <li>
        Most apartments will have white walls and roofs for better climate
        control
        <ul>
          <li>
            The rule of thumb is that the "white wall policy" will stay intact
            until we no longer need A/C and heater in each apartment unit (aka
            we beat the climate change!)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        There will be no houses (only apartments) to discourage one person
        owning a "large" amount of land that will push people to live further
        away from each other.
        <ul>
          <li>
            IF there are houses in the future, the discouragement will continue
            (e.g. high property tax)
          </li>
          <li>
            For noise concerns, the newer apartments will be built with better
            noise handling technologies
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Your apartment <i>number</i> will be four digit alphanumeric letters.
        For example, someone who lives in area B, building G, 4th floor and 8th
        apartment will have an apartment <i>number</i> of BG48.
      </li>
