          There will be no guns allowed in the city. Any attempt to bringing
          guns into the city will kick out all related people out of the city
          (i.e. permanent ban to the city)
        </li>
        <li>The police will not have guns either</li>
        <li>
          The police will always wear a vest with camera recording and will be
          required to share the video recording when the court requests such.
          The police may request to make the video recording private to minimize
          the exposure of the video to the rest of the world in case it may harm
          people unrelated to the direct issue; the court will determine whether
          to uphold such request. If the police officer refuses to share the
          video recording to the court upon request, they will lose their
          authority as a police officer immediately.

          The walking parts of the city will be well-lit at night. The{" "}

          Under the U.S. law, people have the right to own guns. In order to own
          a gun, they may purchase it outside the city and rent a storage place
          on the edges of the city where they could pick it up before they leave
          the city for hunting and such. They will not be able to bring the gun
          into the city and it will be heavily monitored.

          In environmental aspect, there will be a process to determine whether
          the goods can be displayed on stores for purchase. One major criteria
          will include disposability; if it is biodegradable, it will pass the
          test much easier. (including the packaging)

          Making beef generates more greenhouse gases than making pork or
          chicken. Thus the heavier environmental community tax.

          Ideally the food waste will turn into fertilizer and will be used in
          the outer-city farm

        <li>
          Community tax will include "disposable fee" for disposing item itself
          as well as packages (encouraging biodegradable wrappers).
