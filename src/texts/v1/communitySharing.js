      If you break something, you will have to pay to have it fixed (your
      stipend will not cover this). Until then, you will not be able to rent
      from that category (e.g. bikes, Instruments)
      <ul>
        <li>You can borrow at most 1-2 items per category</li>
        <li>
          If you break more than 3-5 items and haven’t repaid yet (or this may
          be determined by the cost) then you won’t be able to borrow anything
          else from the city until you repay
        </li>
